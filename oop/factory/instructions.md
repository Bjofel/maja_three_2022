Hi there!

This is an assignment constructed for you to practice implementing interfaces and classes.

Perform the following tasks to complete the assignment:

1. Crate a factory of your liking!
2. The factory should produce any item you want!
3. The factory needs workers!
4. The factory needs crates of item parts to create items!
5. The factory needs to be setup properly before it starts producing!
6. When it produces items, an unfinished item is passed from machine to machine!
7. When a machine is out of parts, a worker can take items from a crate to the machine!
8. A worker can take an item from one machine to another!
9. Good luck!
10. Make sure someone can try out the produced item eventually!
